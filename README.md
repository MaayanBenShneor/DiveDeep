# About
For my final project in software engineering I decided to make a game about a diver in a complicated underwater cave system.
The goal is to collect gold and explore the map as well as buying upgrades and boosters with the gold you mine.

## Main Algorithm
The main algorithm in the game is that the map is procedurally generated each time the player starts a new game.
The map is generated with the <a href="https://roguebasin.com/index.php/Cellular_Automata_Method_for_Generating_Random_Cave-Like_Levels" target="_blank"><b>Cellular Automata</b></a> algorithm applied with
certain rules to form a cave like structure.
